I’m currently a first-year Ph.D. student in the School of Journalism and Communication, at Nanjing University, advised by Cheng-Jun Wang(https://chengjunwang.com/#about). I’m also a member of Computational Communication Collaboratory(https://chengjun.github.io/socrateslab/), at Nanjing University.

my research interests are in international communication and computational communication, with a focus on using some computational methods to do empirical researches, like comparing media narratives, as well as exploring same ways to enhance the international communication abilities of Chinese media.

Outside work, I am also a enthusiast of badminton and debate, which help me keep fit and achieve a work-life balance.I was a member of the Sichuan University Debate Team and the University of Chinese Academy of Social Sciences Debate Team.
